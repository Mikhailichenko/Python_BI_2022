# numpy homework

When the script is called as the main one, **3 arrays** are created in different ways: the _first_ one consists of 10 zeros; the _second_ is a series of consecutive subtractions of 7 out of 1000; the _third_ contains 10 random numbers

The script also contains a number of **functions** with the following characteristics:
* **matrix_multiplication**. Takes 2 matrices, multiplies them and produces the resulting matrix.
* **multiplication_check**. Takes a list of matrices and returns True if they can be multiplied with each other in the order they appear in the list, and False if they can't be multiplied.
* **multiply_matrices**. Takes a list of matrices and returns the result of the multiplication if it can be obtained, or returns None if they cannot be multiplied
* **compute_2d_distance**. Takes 2 one-dimensional arrays with a pair of values and calculates the distance between them
* **compute_multidimensional_distance**. Takes 2 one-dimensional arrays with any number of values (but equal) and calculates the distance between them
* **compute_pair_distances**. Takes a 2d array, where each row is an observation and each column is a coordinate along the corresponding multidimensional axis. The function calculates the matrix of pairwise distances and gives it to the user.
